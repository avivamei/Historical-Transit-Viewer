## Timeline

The project TA has been provided with a list of tasks that the team has left to do before the project is completed. Each task has been given a reasonable deadline.

The timeline will need to contain enough detail for your TA to use later in the semester to help determine if the team has fallen off track.

Note: The timeline is not used to pass judgement on project progress as we understand everyone has different commitments and workloads. We just want everyone to be on the same page with regards to what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by.
